# Phase-stability-analyzer

Set of routines to perform electrochemical stability analysis of SSE by complete enumeration of possible decomposition reactions and associated potential , as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02251.pdf . Energy of materials are downloaded from the Materials Project and error estimates for the potential of the instability reactions are provided. An example notebook "Example.ipynb" shows example of a possible usage.
